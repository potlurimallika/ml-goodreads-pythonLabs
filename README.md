# ml-goodreads-pythonLabs
This repository holds the Goodreads Books ML Model final project for our Python Labs class.  In this project, our group wanted to identify if there were features that could determine a book's rating. This project was meant for us to collaborate on an end-to-end pipeline to answer a given problem or user case.
